  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Data Science postgraduate with a solid academic foundation in Computer Science and applied analytics, focused on building practical, data-driven solutions.
    My core strengths lie in Python, SQL, and data analysis, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Power BI to extract insights and automate workflows.
    I have worked on end-to-end machine learning and deep learning projects spanning computer vision, recommendation systems, NLP, and IoT-based monitoring.
    My work emphasizes clean data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization for accuracy and performance.


  </p>

  <p>
    I approach problems with an analytical mindset and a strong understanding of business and operational contexts.
    I have experience translating real-world requirements into scalable technical solutions.
    I am comfortable working independently as well as collaborating within cross-functional teams.
  </p>

  <p>
   I actively upskill through projects, workshops, and applied experimentation.
   I am driven by continuous learning and the application of data science to solve meaningful problems.
   I am currently seeking opportunities in data analytics and data science roles where I can deliver measurable impact.
